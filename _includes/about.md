## About

The Greenworks Dashboard is a joint project between the City of Philadelphia's [Office of Sustainability](https://beta.phila.gov/departments/office-of-sustainability/programs/greenworks/) and [Office of Open Data and Digital Transformation](https://beta.phila.gov/departments/office-of-the-chief-administrative-officer/functions/office-of-open-data-and-digital-transformation/).

This dashboard provides easy-to-use responsive visualization tools for viewing data about the eight sustainability visions set in [Greenworks: A Vision for a Sustainable Philadelphia](https://beta.phila.gov/documents/greenworks-a-vision-for-a-sustainable-philadelphia/).


**Note:** _This data will be updated as available on an ongoing basis._
